## Bulking Algorithm
“Bulking”, “Massing” and “Gaining”  are all terms used to describe a period of time where an individual
is purposely eating more calories (aka overfeeding) than they need to maintain their weight.
This is usually done with the end goal of gaining muscle or improving sports performance because
the best “gains” are typically seen in a calorie surplus. By now it is also well documented that
you can only gain a finite amount of muscle over any given period of time and that excess weight
gained will likely be stored as fat. This highlights the importance of having a tight control on
the size of the calorie surplus when bulking because the size of the surplus directly influences
the rate of weight gain. 

An algorithm is a step by step solution consisting of clear instructions. Like a cooking recipe.
Most people think of computers when the word algorithm is brought up, but any step by step procedure
is an algorithm. The process of determining the size of an individual's calorie surplus when they are
bulking can also be described as an algorithm 

## Motivation
The goal of this repository is to describe a simple algorithm that can be used to help individuals
find a calorie surplus that mitigates the risk of them gaining weight too fast or too slow.
